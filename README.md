# Car Price Prediction
## by Sofiyah Olaiwon


## Dataset - Great Motors Deals Data

- The data used in this analysis was gotten from Great Motors Deals, a company that deals in used cars, with a huge market base in Nigeria. The company has a unique platform where customers can buy and sell cars. A seller posts details about the vehicle for review by the companyâ€™s mechanic on the platform to ascertain the vehicle's value. The company then lists the car for sale at the best price. Great Motors makes its profit by receiving a percentage of the selling price listed on the company platform. To ensure the car's selling price is the best for both the customer selling the vehicle and Great Motors, we want to create predictive model for determining the price of the car.

## Project
- Our objective is to predict the price (Amount (Million Naira) the company should sell a car based on the available data (Location, Maker, Model, Year, Colour, Amount (Million Naira), Type, Distance). This project utilized these features to train a ridge regression model that will predict the selling price of a car.
